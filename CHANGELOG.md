# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - release candidate

- Complete and validate second- and fourth-order CPU curvature/energy solvers.
- Repair tensor indexing, frame conversion, energy-condition maps and scalars.
- Correct built-in metric generators and complete the spherical warp shell.
- Add component and 3+1 slice plotting with returned Matplotlib figures.
- Add pinned MATLAB fixtures, analytic/convergence tests and hardware tests.
- Fix DirectML precision and strided stencil writes; keep SI scaling on CPU.
- Add CI, distribution checks, examples, API documentation and release guide.

Compatibility notes: plots use one-based slice arguments; computation uses
zero-based Python array indices. Plot functions no longer show windows
implicitly. DirectML curvature uses float32. Analysis remains on CPU.
See `docs/reference-validation.md` for intentional upstream differences.
